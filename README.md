# python-api-challenge
This is the Module 6 Challenge in the Data Boot Camp that introduced APIs.

This was possibly the most difficult yet rewarding challenge yet. Being able to make requests from and work with actual APIs, like OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify, makes this boot camp come to life, as I can now begin to study and visualize real world data. I am continually impressed by some of the functions utilized by some of the libraries. For instance, the combination of random.uniform in numpy, and nearest_city in citipy can instantly generate coordinates to test API requests. Excited to learn other effective and exciting function combinations to explore more APIs in the in future. 

During the challenge I utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant for some reminders on some of the more basic sections of coding, such as adding an empty column, dropping null values, and utilizing the .copy() function in Pandas.
